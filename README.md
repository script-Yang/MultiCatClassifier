# ResNet-classifies-multiple-types-of-cats
A simple model to classify different cat species using pretrained resnet models.


## Introduction
We used the pre-trained ImageNet ResNet model, changed its fully connected layer, and got 95.90% accuracy on the test set.
## datasets
5 classes of cats
## train
Just run the train.ipynb
## test
